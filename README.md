# Project Summary

We have the front end ready to utilize an API to interact with a database of employees. We need to make sure that our application is sending the right HTTP requests (per documentation) to do so. An offsite group is working on setting up the interface and database for us though, so we need to create a MOCK API.  For this project we'll be using the open source version of SoapUI. [Download SoapUI here.](https://www.soapui.org/downloads/soapui.html)

You will know your mock API is working fully when you point this application to it and see the requests logged in the correct format.
